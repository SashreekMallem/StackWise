# StackWise: Smart Budget Optimizer AI - Complete Workspace Explanation

## üéØ What is StackWise?

**StackWise** is an advanced AI-powered budget optimization platform designed to help users make intelligent purchase decisions by aggregating prices, finding deals, and optimizing savings across multiple sources. The project uses the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** for AI agent integrations to provide smart purchase planning and automated deal discovery.

## üöÄ Core Features

### 1. Price Aggregation & Analysis
- **Real-time price fetching** from Google Shopping via SerpAPI
- **Location-aware results** to find nearby store prices
- **Intelligent unit price calculation** using LLM to extract quantities from product titles
- **Multi-store comparison** with delivery options and product details

### 2. Smart Savings Engine (Layered Approach)
- **Layer 1**: Discounted gift cards (4-7% savings on major retailers)
- **Layer 2**: Digital coupons and promotional deals
- **Layer 3**: Credit card perks and cashback optimization
- **Layer 4**: Platform-specific cashback (Rakuten, Honey integration planned)

### 3. Budget & List Management
- **Monthly budget tracking** with spending limits
- **Dual shopping lists**: Separate wishlist and grocery management
- **Item categorization** with urgency levels and frequency tracking
- **User profile management** including credit card optimization

### 4. AI-Powered Intelligence
- **LLM quantity extraction**: Automatically parses "2-pack", "gallon", "12 oz" from titles
- **Smart unit comparisons**: Price per gallon, pound, ounce, or count
- **Effective price calculation**: Final cost after all savings layers applied

## üìä API Endpoints

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup & Usage

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Required API keys (add to .env file)
SERPAPI_KEY=your_serpapi_key_here
COUPONSAPI_KEY=your_couponsapi_key_here
```

### Installation
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -e .

# Run the FastAPI server
python -m src.smart_budget_mcp.server
# Server available at: http://localhost:8080
```

### Example Usage

1. **Set up user profile**:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/profile/cards \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"card_names": ["Target RedCard", "Chase Freedom"]}'

curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/budget \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"monthly_limit": 2500}'
```

2. **Add items to shopping lists**:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/wishlist/items \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "iPhone 15", "urgency": "high"}'

curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/groceries/items \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "milk", "quantity": 2, "frequency": "weekly"}'
```

3. **Analyze shopping list for best deals**:
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8080/shopping_list_value?items=milk&items=coffee&location=Seattle&num=5"
```

## üí° How the Savings Engine Works

The system analyzes each product offer through multiple discount layers:

1. **Base Price**: Raw price from Google Shopping
2. **Gift Card Discount**: 4-7% savings for supported retailers
3. **Credit Card Perks**: Category-specific cashback (5% groceries, etc.)
4. **Final Effective Price**: Base √ó (1 - gift_card_discount) √ó (1 - credit_card_perk)

### Example Calculation
```
Base Price: $100 Target item
Gift Card Discount: 4% (buy $100 Target gift card for $96)
Credit Card Perk: 5% (Target RedCard discount)
Final Price: $100 √ó 0.96 √ó 0.95 = $91.20
Total Savings: $8.80 (8.8%)
```

## üè¢ Business Model & Vision

### Target Problem
