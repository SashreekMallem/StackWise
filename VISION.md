## 🧠 How It Works (High-Level Flow)

### 🛍️ 1. **Wishlist & Smart Planning**

* User adds desired purchases (e.g., headphones, laptop, vacation).
* Sets:

  * Budget goals (e.g., monthly $1000)
  * Urgency (“need in 2 weeks” vs “low priority”)
  * Brand preferences or strict needs.

> ✅ AI tracks prices, predicts drops, and tells user:
> “Buy now or wait? Here’s why.”

---

### 🛒 2. **Dedicated Grocery Optimization Module**

* User adds grocery items weekly.
* App finds:

  * Cheapest combinations across stores (Walmart, Target, etc.)
  * Smart swaps for cheaper brands
  * Coupons, gift card discounts, loyalty rewards, and credit card perks

> ✅ Automatically builds a smart cart that fits under your grocery budget — even suggests shifting items.

---

### 💰 3. **Stackable Smart Savings Engine**

For every item (groceries or wishlist), app checks:

* ✅ Gift card hacks (e.g. $100 for $85 via Raise)
* ✅ Credit card perks (5% on groceries, 3x points on electronics)
* ✅ Cashback offers (Rakuten, Honey, etc.)
* ✅ Store loyalty or bundle offers

> ✅ “Here’s how to buy this $400 item for $312 effective cost — today.”

---

### 📊 4. **Live Budget Intelligence**

* You set a monthly limit — say $800.
* The app tracks everything:

  * What you already spent
  * What’s left
  * What can fit now
  * What to postpone
* Recommends **smart purchase sequencing** based on affordability and savings potential

> ✅ “Delay that shoe purchase till next week — you can afford both the AirPods and groceries this week.”

---

### 🤖 5. **AI Agents to Automate Everything**

* Agents monitor wishlist, prices, budget, and new offers
* Alerts when:

  * You can finally afford something
  * There’s a flash deal
  * A better substitute is available
* Future: agents will **auto-plan monthly purchases** to maximize savings

---

### 🔐 6. **Privacy & Control**

* Users can choose:

  * Manual control (“Tell me when to buy”)
  * Semi-auto (“Buy if all conditions met”)
  * Full auto (“Buy cheapest grocery list every Sunday under $100”)
